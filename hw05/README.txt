matrixLED
This part of the homework builds of of the pre existing code provided. All the changes are in the file matrixLED.js and matrixLED.css
In this homework the goal was to take the web server, run it on the bone, and be able to read as well as control an LED matrix connected to the bone over 12c.
this was accomplished by addignmore colors to hte css file as well as modifing the js file. I changed this file so that when a led is clicked on I first check to see what color the led is. from there i toggle on or off LEDs to change it to the next color.

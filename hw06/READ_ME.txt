Display Images
This section of the homework was to display a image using fbi -noverbose -T 1 -a boris.png and then be able to rotate it. i have 4 shell scripts that when run after on.sh will rotate the image when displayed. These are called turn0.sh, turn90.sh, turn 180.sh, and turn 270.sh.

Play Moives
This section was to play a moive and be able to rotate it. I used the same scripts as before and am able to play movies at diffrent angles.

Generate text 
This section was to mess around with imagemagick. The tast was to take an image, display it and then write on it. This can be seen in the file mytext.sh

Writing pixels to the LED
This was the meat of the homework and the tast was to imporve upon the etch-a-sketch.c
What i did was imterface with a third incoder. This incoder controled the draw size of the etch. This curser size is between 1 pixel and 32 pixel square and will rap around the screen. These is in bug that can happen. If the curser is at max size and the center is at a corner it will sometimes throw and error but not always.

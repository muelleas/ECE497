HW03

TMP101
In this Part of the homework is present in i2ctmp101.py
This program I have two tmp101's on the i2c bus with their alert pins on the GPIO in GP0. When the sensor passes high voltage given in the program the alert pin changes. when this happens I read the sensor and then print the tempeture in F to thte terminal.

Etch-a-sketch
This part of the program can be found in the file Etchwdisplay.py
This program build off of the design in the last homework. The same 4 buttons exist on GP0 and they act as directions with the PAUSE button being reset. The dispaly is on the i2c bus and will display the gameboard. When you push the buttons the cursor will move around the screen leaving a trail in its path.

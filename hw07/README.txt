GPIO Speed
The point of this homework assinment was tocompair the speed of different meathods of copying GPIO signels fromon to another. I used Python, C, and a kernel module to do this in the files gpiocopy.py, gpiocopy.c, and GPIO_test.ko respetivly. All of my results can be seen in the document called writeup.

// Results look good, though I'd rather a scope capture than a phone capture.

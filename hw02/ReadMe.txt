HW02

NOTE: I have done this homework in both js and python. I first did it in js and then later python to make the next homework easier. Either file is useable and the names are the same with only the extentions different

Buttons and LEDs
This part of the homework is present in the file called fourbuttons.js
This program takes four inputs in the form of buttons plugged in on the GP0. Each of these buttons has a matching LED on the GP1 bus. When a button is pressed the matching LED is toggled from its previous state. Each button is debounced so only one push is detected.

Etch-a-sketch
this part of the homework is in the file EtchWButtons.js.
This program takes the idea of the etch-a-sketch from the first homework and then adds buttons to act as control inputs. The buttons are plugged in to GP0. These buttons operate interrups that update the screen with the moved curser. The pause button acts as a clear button. The buttons are still debounced like the last part.

# Comments from Prof. Yoder
# Looks good. Which is easier to use Python or Javascript?
